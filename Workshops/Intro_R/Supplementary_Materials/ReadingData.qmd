##How can I use a dataset from another file in R?

There are many functions you can use to read in data in R, depending upon what file type you have. Here are some examples of reading in data using the most common filetypes.

##File paths

Before we get into examples, we need to understand how to tell the computer where files are. 

Whenever you are using a function to read in data (such as `read_csv()`, `read_sheet()`, `read_excel`), you'll provide the function a filepath, telling the computer which file you want to have it parse into a data frame. 

There are a few important things to keep in mind here:
- A file path is always a string (it has quotes around it), like "mydata.csv".
- The file path can tell the computer what to do in two ways:
- first, we can give the "absolute file path". The string you would enter as your file path might look something like this: "/Users/kylesuelflow/Macalester-Stuff/STAT_155/data/mydata.csv"
- This is really long! *We don't need to do this!*
  
```{r}

```
  
  
- Instead, use *relative file paths*
- Relative paths show the file path relative to where your working directory is. 

How do I know where my working directory is?
 
- Use `getWd()` to get your working directory
- Whenever you reload R Studio, always go to Session->Set Working Directory->To Source File location.
- This sets your working directory relative to where your .rmd (or .R, .qmd, etc.) is located.

What is the syntax for using relative paths?

- In the above folder structure, my code file is in the code folder, and my data set is in the data folder
- Since my working directory is set to my code file, in order to access the data, we need to go *up* a folder
- To do this, we'll use "../data"
- The ".." is what moves us up a folder. The "/" gets us *inside* or *down* into the data folder

- From here, we need to go access the data file in the data folder
- We'll use another "/" to do this
- The full file path is as follows: "../data/my_data.csv"
  
##Examples

Note: If you do not have these packages installed yet, please do so!

```{r}
library(readr) #this package contains read_csv()
library(googlesheets4) #this package contains read_sheet()
library(readxl) #this package contains read_excel()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_csv_data <- read_csv("./data/my_data.csv") 

my_excel_data <- read_excel("../data/my_data/xls") #Also reads in .xlsx files.
```

Google sheets are a bit different, given that it is not a file path.

What we need is the *sheet id*, which can be found here, highlighted in red:

You can specify which sheet to read in if you multiple sheets with the `sheet = ` argument. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_google_sheet_data <- read_sheet("1fdAxRjBw3k7gTTZtTd4usUpOev3f_TIN5meLQpE8aKk", sheet = ____)
```
